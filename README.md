Python – Try & Except (Exception Handling)

This folder contains a brief explanation of how Python handles errors using the try and except blocks. Exception handling allows a program to detect and respond to errors without crashing.

It helps in:

Catching unexpected errors

Providing user-friendly error messages

Keeping the program running smoothly

Handling different types of runtime issues safely

This section also covers else and finally, which help manage code execution when errors do or do not occur.
